BUILD SETTINGS THE SCENES
--------------------------

The first time you import the package, all the levels, menu and level selection menu are NOT in the build settings.

If you first try out the scenes and it gives you the error '1 or any other number couldn't be loaded because it has not been added to 
the build settings' then you have to go to the FILE > BUILD SETTINGS and click open up the GameMenu scene.

Click on the 'Add Open Scenes' button and it should add the GameMenu scene in the BUILD SETTINGS.


After you add the GameMenu scene then add the LevelSelectionMenu scene and add the other levels from 1 to 5.

They should be like this:

Game Menu = Scene 0
Level Selection Menu = Scene 1
Level 1 = Scene 2
Level 2 = Scene 3
Level 3 = Scene 4
Level 4 = Scene 5
Level 5 = Scene 6


Once that is done, test out the package now and it should be working perfectly.
